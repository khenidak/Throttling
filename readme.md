# Non Locking Throttling Component#
This code and samples are part of a blog post published here http://henidak.com/2015/08/writing-a-non-locking-throttling-component/

This component allows you to throttle requests to certain resource (for example 1000 request every 10 seconds) without the need to lock in memory data structures.  

The sample code also contains a lock based implementation that can be used for learning purposes.
